## Purpose
This library is for Spring boot applications that require access to [DeepStackAI](https://www.deepstack.cc/) API's.

## Features
This library handles the following API endpoints for Deepstack
* Face Detection, Face Recognition, Face Registration
* Object Detection
* Scene Detection

Authentication and the other Face API's will be adding soon.

## Getting Started

The library isn't release to maven central at the moment but should be soon. The only way to use this library currently is to download the source and build it.
